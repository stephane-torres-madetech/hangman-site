# Hangman Project Expanded

Using the simple CLI hangman created using a tutorial from Real Python[https://realpython.com/python-hangman/#prerequisites] to expand into
a web app using React on the frontend and Flask on the back

## Setting up Flask Server

Created using python3.9

```
cd flask-server
python3.9 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

Flask runs app on port 5000 by default
